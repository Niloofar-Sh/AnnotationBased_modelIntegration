    **Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Cascade**
=====================================

The Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade is a signalling pathway, which activates in respond to a stimulus and amplifies the input signal [1]_ and [2]_. It contributes in multiple biological processes. The cascade consists of three layers (totally five cycles) as in Figure 2.

    Figure 2. Layers and cycles in the MAPK cascade.


The repetitive structure in the cycles makes the MAPK cascade a suitable example of reusabilty. Here, as mentioned in `The Approach`_, we demonstrate how the model of the whole cascade can be implemented auomatically
